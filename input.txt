It is best to save the file to a temporary directory that you’ve created just for this purpose. For example, I have a subdirectory on my hard drive named \TEMPDOWN which I use strictly for downloading and decompressing files. That way you always know where the file is and you can always move it from there to a more permanent location when you are finished with it.
Use a decompressing utility on the downloaded file. Here you have to use some thought. If the compressed file has a folder structure inside the file you may have to let the utility create this folder structure on your hard drive. Most archives with multiple files in them will have a text file with directions. It is usually called README.TXT, INSTALL.TXT, or some other similar file. Most decompression programs have the capability of displaying the contents of the archive and extracting/viewing single files in the archive. If you see an instruction file we recommend you read it first, to determine what steps are required to actually dearchive, install and/or launch the program.
Some programs do not require any additional installation process. In these cases, you can simply create a permanent directory for the program, and copy the files from your temporary directory to the permanent program directory.
Once you’ve completely installed the program, and you are sure that it works properly, you can go back and delete the various installation files from your temporary subdirectory. However, you should keep a copy of the original archive file just in case you need to install it again in the future.

Most archives with multiple files in them will have a text file with directions. It is usually called README.TXT, INSTALL.TXT, or some other similar file. Most decompression programs have the capability of displaying the contents of the archive and extracting/viewing single files in the archive. If you see an instruction file we recommend you read it first, to determine what steps are required to actually dearchive, install and/or launch the program.
Some programs do not require any additional installation process. In these cases, you can simply create a permanent directory for the program, and copy the files from your temporary directory to the permanent program directory.
Once you’ve completely installed the program, and you are sure that it works properly, you can go back and delete the various installation files from your temporary subdirectory. However, you should keep a copy of the original archive file just in case you need to install it again in the future.
Download a file simply by clicking on its filename (or on whatever link the author has provided).
In Internet Explorer choose the save to disk option from the download dialog. In Firefox you will also be given an option to save to disk. If you are using Netscape, it may say “No Viewer Configured for File Type…” just choose the save or save to disk option.
It is best to save the file to a temporary directory that you’ve created just for this purpose. For example, I have a subdirectory on my hard drive named \TEMPDOWN which I use strictly for downloading and decompressing files. That way you always know where the file is and you can always move it from there to a more permanent location when you are finished with it.

That way you always know where the file is and you can always move it from there to a more permanent location when you are finished with it.
Use a decompressing utility on the downloaded file. Here you have to use some thought. If the compressed file has a folder structure inside the file you may have to let the utility create this folder structure on your hard drive. Most archives with multiple files in them will have a text file with directions. It is usually called README.TXT, INSTALL.TXT, or some other similar file. Most decompression programs have the capability of displaying the contents of the archive and extracting/viewing single files in the archive. If you see an instruction file we recommend you read it first, to determine what steps are required to actually dearchive, install and/or launch the program.
Some programs do not require any additional installation process. In these cases, you can simply create a permanent directory for the program, and copy the files from your temporary directory to the permanent program directory.
Once you’ve completely installed the program, and you are sure that it works properly, you can go back and delete the various installation files from your temporary subdirectory. However, you should keep a copy of the original archive file just in case you need to install it again in the future.Download a file simply by clicking on its filename (or on whatever link the author has provided).
In Internet Explorer choose the save to disk option from the download dialog. In Firefox you will also be given an option to save to disk. If you are using Netscape, it may say “No Viewer Configured for File Type…” just choose the save or save to disk option.

In Internet Explorer choose the save to disk option from the download dialog. In Firefox you will also be given an option to save to disk. If you are using Netscape, it may say “No Viewer Configured for File Type…” just choose the save or save to disk option.
It is best to save the file to a temporary directory that you’ve created just for this purpose. For example, I have a subdirectory on my hard drive named \TEMPDOWN which I use strictly for downloading and decompressing files. That way you always know where the file is and you can always move it from there to a more permanent location when you are finished with it.
Use a decompressing utility on the downloaded file. Here you have to use some thought. If the compressed file has a folder structure inside the file you may have to let the utility create this folder structure on your hard drive. Most archives with multiple files in them will have a text file with directions. It is usually called README.TXT, INSTALL.TXT, or some other similar file. Most decompression programs have the capability of displaying the contents of the archive and extracting/viewing single files in the archive. If you see an instruction file we recommend you read it first, to determine what steps are required to actually dearchive, install and/or launch the program.
Some programs do not require any additional installation process. In these cases, you can simply create a permanent directory for the program, and copy the files from your temporary directory to the permanent program directory.

Some programs do not require any additional installation process. In these cases, you can simply create a permanent directory for the program, and copy the files from your temporary directory to the permanent program directory.
Once you’ve completely installed the program, and you are sure that it works properly, you can go back and delete the various installation files from your temporary subdirectory. However, you should keep a copy of the original archive file just in case you need to install it again in the future.Download a file simply by clicking on its filename (or on whatever link the author has provided).
In Internet Explorer choose the save to disk option from the download dialog. In Firefox you will also be given an option to save to disk. If you are using Netscape, it may say “No Viewer Configured for File Type…” just choose the save or save to disk option.
It is best to save the file to a temporary directory that you’ve created just for this purpose. For example, I have a subdirectory on my hard drive named \TEMPDOWN which I use strictly for downloading and decompressing files. That way you always know where the file is and you can always move it from there to a more permanent location when you are finished with it.
Use a decompressing utility on the downloaded file. Here you have to use some thought. If the compressed file has a folder structure inside the file you may have to let the utility create this folder structure on your hard drive. Most archives with multiple files in them will have a text file with directions. It is usually called README.TXT, INSTALL.TXT, or some other similar file.

Most archives with multiple files in them will have a text file with directions. It is usually called README.TXT, INSTALL.TXT, or some other similar file. Most decompression programs have the capability of displaying the contents of the archive and extracting/viewing single files in the archive. If you see an instruction file we recommend you read it first, to determine what steps are required to actually dearchive, install and/or launch the program.
Some programs do not require any additional installation process. In these cases, you can simply create a permanent directory for the program, and copy the files from your temporary directory to the permanent program directory.
Once you’ve completely installed the program, and you are sure that it works properly, you can go back and delete the various installation files from your temporary subdirectory. However, you should keep a copy of the original archive file just in case you need to install it again in the future.Download a file simply by clicking on its filename (or on whatever link the author has provided).
In Internet Explorer choose the save to disk option from the download dialog. In Firefox you will also be given an option to save to disk. If you are using Netscape, it may say “No Viewer Configured for File Type…” just choose the save or save to disk option.
It is best to save the file to a temporary directory that you’ve created just for this purpose. For example, I have a subdirectory on my hard drive named \TEMPDOWN which I use strictly for downloading and decompressing files. That way you always know where the file is and you can always move it from there to a more permanent location when you are finished with it.

That way you always know where the file is and you can always move it from there to a more permanent location when you are finished with it.
Use a decompressing utility on the downloaded file. Here you have to use some thought. If the compressed file has a folder structure inside the file you may have to let the utility create this folder structure on your hard drive. Most archives with multiple files in them will have a text file with directions. It is usually called README.TXT, INSTALL.TXT, or some other similar file. Most decompression programs have the capability of displaying the contents of the archive and extracting/viewing single files in the archive. If you see an instruction file we recommend you read it first, to determine what steps are required to actually dearchive, install and/or launch the program.
Some programs do not require any additional installation process. In these cases, you can simply create a permanent directory for the program, and copy the files from your temporary directory to the permanent program directory.
Once you’ve completely installed the program, and you are sure that it works properly, you can go back and delete the various installation files from your temporary subdirectory. However, you should keep a copy of the original archive file just in case you need to install it again in the future.Download a file simply by clicking on its filename (or on whatever link the author has provided).
In Internet Explorer choose the save to disk option from the download dialog. In Firefox you will also be given an option to save to disk. If you are using Netscape, it may say “No Viewer Configured for File Type…” just choose the save or save to disk option.

In Internet Explorer choose the save to disk option from the download dialog. In Firefox you will also be given an option to save to disk. If you are using Netscape, it may say “No Viewer Configured for File Type…” just choose the save or save to disk option.
It is best to save the file to a temporary directory that you’ve created just for this purpose. For example, I have a subdirectory on my hard drive named \TEMPDOWN which I use strictly for downloading and decompressing files. That way you always know where the file is and you can always move it from there to a more permanent location when you are finished with it.
Use a decompressing utility on the downloaded file. Here you have to use some thought. If the compressed file has a folder structure inside the file you may have to let the utility create this folder structure on your hard drive. Most archives with multiple files in them will have a text file with directions. It is usually called README.TXT, INSTALL.TXT, or some other similar file. Most decompression programs have the capability of displaying the contents of the archive and extracting/viewing single files in the archive. If you see an instruction file we recommend you read it first, to determine what steps are required to actually dearchive, install and/or launch the program.
Some programs do not require any additional installation process. In these cases, you can simply create a permanent directory for the program, and copy the files from your temporary directory to the permanent program directory.

Some programs do not require any additional installation process. In these cases, you can simply create a permanent directory for the program, and copy the files from your temporary directory to the permanent program directory.
Once you’ve completely installed the program, and you are sure that it works properly, you can go back and delete the various installation files from your temporary subdirectory. However, you should keep a copy of the original archive file just in case you need to install it again in the future.Download a file simply by clicking on its filename (or on whatever link the author has provided).
In Internet Explorer choose the save to disk option from the download dialog. In Firefox you will also be given an option to save to disk. If you are using Netscape, it may say “No Viewer Configured for File Type…” just choose the save or save to disk option.
It is best to save the file to a temporary directory that you’ve created just for this purpose. For example, I have a subdirectory on my hard drive named \TEMPDOWN which I use strictly for downloading and decompressing files. That way you always know where the file is and you can always move it from there to a more permanent location when you are finished with it.
Use a decompressing utility on the downloaded file. Here you have to use some thought. If the compressed file has a folder structure inside the file you may have to let the utility create this folder structure on your hard drive. Most archives with multiple files in them will have a text file with directions. It is usually called README.TXT, INSTALL.TXT, or some other similar file.

Most archives with multiple files in them will have a text file with directions. It is usually called README.TXT, INSTALL.TXT, or some other similar file. Most decompression programs have the capability of displaying the contents of the archive and extracting/viewing single files in the archive. If you see an instruction file we recommend you read it first, to determine what steps are required to actually dearchive, install and/or launch the program.
Some programs do not require any additional installation process. In these cases, you can simply create a permanent directory for the program, and copy the files from your temporary directory to the permanent program directory.
Once you’ve completely installed the program, and you are sure that it works properly, you can go back and delete the various installation files from your temporary subdirectory. However, you should keep a copy of the original archive file just in case you need to install it again in the future.Download a file simply by clicking on its filename (or on whatever link the author has provided).
In Internet Explorer choose the save to disk option from the download dialog. In Firefox you will also be given an option to save to disk. If you are using Netscape, it may say “No Viewer Configured for File Type…” just choose the save or save to disk option.
It is best to save the file to a temporary directory that you’ve created just for this purpose. For example, I have a subdirectory on my hard drive named \TEMPDOWN which I use strictly for downloading and decompressing files. That way you always know where the file is and you can always move it from there to a more permanent location when you are finished with it.
